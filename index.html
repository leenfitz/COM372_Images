  <h1>Pictures!! Using the img tag and background-image css property</h1>
  <p>Websites are more than just text. We can include images in our html documents in two ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>By using the img tag to include images in the flow of our document</li>
    <li>By using the background-img css property to include an image as the background of a block element</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Typically, images used as page content are included as image tags, and images used to decorate the background are included using the background image property. It is important to include any images that inform the reader about page content using the img tag, since this allows us to set an alt attribute for screen-readers.</p>
  <h2>Image Tag Examples</h2>
  <p>Lets try the image tag now. I've included an incomplete image tag in the text of this paragraph. <img src="" alt="A Polydactyl Cat"> Find the image described in the alt text on the image tag in the Assets folder and include the path to this image as the value for the src attribute to complete the tag.</p>
  <p>Write img tags (with alt text!) to include each of the images described in the list below (each is found somewhere in the assets folder).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prince the Rottweiler (Wikimedia Commons photo by Phil Sangwell)</li>
    <li>A Pallas Cat<
    <li>The SS United States</li>
    <li>The RMS Queen Mary</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Image Background Examples</h2>
  We can also set images as the background of block level elements. By default, these images will be displayed behind block content, cropped if they are smaller than block dimensions, and repeat if they are larger. To see this in action, we can set the background-image property on the div below in our style.css file.
  <div id="background1">
    <h3>An example div to demonstrate a background-image</h3>
    <p>This div will have a background image. Notice how the image display changes as we change the size of the content, and the dimensions of the div.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="background2">
    <h3>Another example div</h3>
    <p>After we learn about the background-image property, try it for yourself on this div. Set the background image, and then experiment with the size of the div.</p>
  </div>
